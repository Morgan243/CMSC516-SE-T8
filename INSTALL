System Prerequisites:
- An internet connection to download python packages
- Python3 available in the path as python3
- Python3 virtual environments library installed
- Python3 Pip

On ubuntu-based systems, you'll probably need these packages:
python3-venv python3-pip build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev

Instructions:
(1) Change directory to the top-level project directory (where this file is located)
(2) Execute 'install.sh', confirm that the proposed location of the virtual environment is okay.
    It defaults to ./venv in the top-level project directory
    - This script will create a virtual environment, then install this package and other prerequisites
(3) Execute 'runit.sh' (while located in the same directory) to execute experiments
