Data loading code for tasks (loaders.load_subtask*) are based on the code provided
 with the SemEval 2018 dataset. Minor modifications were made to better suit our needs.

 Scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch documentation were referenced throughout, so some
 code may be similar to various examples from these projects.
