If you are using 3rd party code or data, please make this very clear by keeping that content in directories
separate from your own, and by clearly documenting the origins of this code or data in a plain text file
called ORIGINS that is included in each 3rd party directory. Each 3rd party source should have its own
separate directory. These guidelines also apply to Semeval task descriptions and data.  If you modify third
party code keep that in a separate directory as well, and clearly indicate in the comments to that program
where your modifications begin and end. All code and documentation that you submit as being authored
by your team must be completely and only authored by members of your team.
